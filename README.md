# SKAT JS

Code generation and templating for your project your way.

The tool copies templates and performs substitutions on its contents based on values passed it from the command line.
SKAT does not contain any templates itself, you must create them all.

This package is only an adapter for the JavaScript ecosystem. The engine behind it can be
seen [here](https://github.com/dandro/skat-engine).
